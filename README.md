git-test-repo
=============

A repository does not do anything but just exists for me to be able to practise
git commands and see how all my actions can affect both local and remote.

I am also planning to use this repository as todo lists for my projects.  

TODOs
-----

Recently I came up with a JavaScript framework called MeteorJS.
A few weeks back, when I was watching a Node.js advocate doing one of the Meteor official tutorials while live-coding at live.nicovideo.jp.
I, for some reason, also stared doing one of the tutorials not so long later than that day.
It was a very fun experience for me to work on the tutorial.

Now, I am thinking about making a web application using MeteorJS.

I have two Meteor app ideas:

- one is a topic generator app is to help out participants of a language exchange meetup;
- and the other is a simple bingo game app that may be helpful to my gym mates.

I am going to add detailed TODOs for each app soon.

Notes

### The seven rules of a great git commit message

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

See the blog post: [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for details.
