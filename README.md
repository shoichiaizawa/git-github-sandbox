-------------

A repository does not do anything but just exists for me to be able to practise
git commands and see how all my actions can affect both local and remote.

Notes

### The seven rules of a great git commit message

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
