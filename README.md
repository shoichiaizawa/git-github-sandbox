=============

A repository does not do anything but just exists for me to be able to practise
git commands and see how all my actions can affect both local and remote.

Notes

### The seven rules of a great git commit message

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

See the blog post: [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for details.
