git-github-sandbox
==================

A repository does not do anything but just exists for me to be able to play around with git commands and see how all my actions can affect both local and remote.

I am also planning to use this repository as my todo lists for my projects or general stuff, for now at least I can say.

![Eisenhower Matrix](img/eisenhower-box.jpg)

Upon assigning my daily tasks, I am planning to use the [Eisenhower Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method). I might not use the method as it is supposed to be but I roughly use this method in a way that I feel comfortable to work on. Instead of using the four quadrants I use four separate unordered lists.

### Eisenhower List

##### TODO-1: Important, Urgent

- [ ] Reply emails
- [ ] Sort contracts

##### TODO-2: Important, Not urgent

- Do meteor tutorials as many as possible:
    - [Official Todo Apps](https://www.meteor.com/learn)
    - [scotch.io](https://scotch.io/?s=meteor)
    - [angular-meteor.com](http://angular-meteor.com/)
    - and more
- [ ] Install some basic npm packages globally for tweaking

        ```
        # Previously I installed these packages
        # when Node.js + npm were installed via Homebrew,
        # and I don't know these should have been installed globally.
        $ npm list -g --depth=0

### TODO-lst-1: Creating simple Meteor apps for people

Recently I came up with the Meteor JavaScript framework and I am in an excitement.

A few weeks back, when I was watching a Japanese Node.js advocate doing one of the Meteor official tutorials while live-coding at live.nicovideo.jp.
I, for some reason, was inspired by what he does with this JavaScript framework with a catchy name – Meteor! How cool is that :D
Not so long later than that day, I stared doing one of the tutorials at https://www.meteor.com/install and you know what happened? I instantly fell in love with it! It was a very fun experience for me to work on the tutorial. Seeing my app going on live on the Meteor's free testing server was a truly pleasant experience.

As of November 2015, I still do not know how to write HTML/CSS nor any programming language properly but this Meteor thing has really been captivating me.
The official tutorial offers three simple todo apps, the first one which I did only requires HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The second one and the third one are also simple todo apps but you create apps combining AngularJS and React -- I will do these two once I find my spare time slot.

So now what? I am thinking about making a web application using Meteor.

Thankfully I came up with some chances which I may be able to apply this technology. Since I am an absolute beginner, obviously the learning curve is very high and not sure if this is manageable with my current skill levels. But within a month, by an end-of-year party with gym mates, I will try to approach the solution as hard as I can.

Here are the two Meteor app ideas:

1. **A simple bingo game app**
    - this may be helpful to my gym mates at an end-of-year party
    - this may not be necessary but I would like to challenge myself to create a simple bingo game app that can be used for the game to win a present
    - details to be added
2. **A topic generator app**
    - this app is to help out participants of a language exchange meetup
    - an app similar to TableTopics
    - Mr Yuki Sakakibara often thinks it would be nice to have an app like this to save people at each table from not being able to find topics to talk about
    - details to be added

I am going to add detailed TODOs for each app soon.

I am also going to list up my working plan for the projects, especially the bingo game app.

### TODO-lst-2: Some stuff to sort out before 2016 comes

- [ ] Do a clean install the OS X on the SSD, which I bought at the end of April (OMG, I am so lazy...)
- [ ] Delete unused Mac apps
    - I need to do clean install anyway but it would be nice to identify what is important and what is not prior to making the action
- [ ] Delete unused iPhone apps
    - My iPhone only has 4.5 GB ish of the remaining disk space, which is not a lot. Delete the ones I never use.

### TODO-lst-3: What I want to learn in 2016

- Do MOOCs courses
    - I am not going to talk about how MOOC certificates are appealing to employers but better than possessing nothing
        - [open-source-society/computer-science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science) offers a range of Computer Science courses from various MOOC providers
        - [Replicating a BSc in Computer Science through MOOCs](http://gregorulm.com/replicating-a-bsc-in-computer-science-through-moocs/)
            - [gregorulm/mooc](https://github.com/gregorulm/mooc)
        - [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-6) -- starts on January 13, 2016
            - I abandoned the last session half way though because I chose to stay in the audit mode so make sure I pay for the course for a verified track, stay motivated and complete the course
    - bar
    - baz
- Lynda courses
    - The thing is I am a premium annual member and have not studied anything on Lynda.com for a few months... bammer!
- baz

### 2015-11-13

##### Summary

I was planning to work on the existing jekyll generated blog powered by jekyll-bootstrap and host it at username.github.io but in the end I abandoned it. I changed the name of the repository and created another repository named username.github.io.
There is no content at this time. So my next goal about static site blogging is to wrote blog post in a regular basis. I was recommended that I should still to a regular publishing plan. Whether publishing once a day, once in three days or once in a week, it is important to keep on doing it.

- [x] Air the jekyll blog, with or without a unique domain

Not important but I wanted to do

- [x] Subscribe Meteor newsletter -> answered survey
- [x] Sign up at https://unsplash.com/

### 2015-11-12

##### Summary

As planned I did install Node.js and npm via nvm. Spending much time on reading about how to install nvm, I came across some people insisting that [nvm should not be installed via Homebrew at all](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/issues/469) (and even saying nvm installation with Homebrew is an unofficial method; thus one should install nvm only the official way) but I used Homebrew to install it.

Here are some of the websites/blogs I visited when installing nvm:

- https://www.araport.org/docs/science-apps-configuring-development-environment/installing-nodejs
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28017374/what-is-the-suggested-way-to-install-brew-node-js-io-js-nvm-npm-on-os-x
- http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Node.js/README.html

##### Original TODOs

- [x] Install Node.js via brew, nvm, n, nodebrew, or others
    - I would probably go with nvm as it has the most stars on GitHub among other Node.js version managers. Also nvm seems the most active on GitHub
    - Numbers of stars for each project (as of 2015-11-12):
        - [creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) -- 9168 stars
        - [tj/n](https://github.com/tj/n) -- 3252 stars
        - [hokaccha/nodebrew](https://github.com/hokaccha/nodebrew) -- 459 stars
    - Install npm -- npm is automatically comes with a Node.js installation unless you exclude it

### git commit

#### The seven rules of a great git commit message

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

See the blog post: [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for details.
