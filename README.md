git-test-repo
=============

A repository does not do anything but just exists for me to be able to practise
git commands and see how all my actions can affect both local and remote.

I am also planning to use this repository as my todo lists for my projects or general stuff, for now at least I can say.

### TODO-1: Creating simple Meteor apps for people

Recently I came up with the Meteor JavaScript framework and I am in an excitement.
A few weeks back, when I was watching a Japanese Node.js advocate doing one of the Meteor official tutorials while live-coding at live.nicovideo.jp.
I, for some reason, was inspired by what he does with this JavaScript framework with a catchy name â€“ Meteor! How cool is that :D  
Not so long later than that day, I stared doing one of the tutorials at https://www.meteor.com/install and you know what happened? I fell in love with it! It was a very fun experience for me to work on the tutorial. Seeing my app going on live on the Meteor's free testing server was a truly pleasant experience.

As of November 2015, I still do not know how to write HTML/CSS nor any programming language properly but this Meteor thing has really been captivating me.
The official tutorial offers three simple todo apps, the first one which I did only requires HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The second one and the third one are also simple todo apps but you create apps combining AngularJS and React -- I will do these two once I find my spare time slot.

So now what? I am thinking about making a web application using MeteorJS.

Thankfully I came up with some chances which I may be able to apply this technology. Since I am an absolute beginner, obviously the learning curve is very high and not sure if this is manageable with my current skill levels. But within a month, by an end-of-year party with gym mates, I will try to approach the solution as hard as I can.

Here are the two Meteor app ideas:

1. A simple bingo game app that may be helpful to my gym mates at an end-of-year party.
  - this may not be necessary but I would like to challenge myself to create a simple bingo game app that can be used for the game to win a present
  - details to be added
2. A topic generator app is to help out participants of a language exchange meetup
  - an app similar to TableTopics
  - Mr Yuki Sakakibara often thinks it would be nice to have an app like this to save people at each table from not being able to find topics to talk about
  - details to be added

I am going to add detailed TODOs for each app soon.

I am also going to list up my working plan for the projects, especially the bingo game app.

### The seven rules of a great git commit message

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
